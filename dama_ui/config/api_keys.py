"""
API keys for the Dama UI application.
"""

# Groq API Key
GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"

# You can add more API keys here if needed for other services
# For example:
# OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key_here"
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "your_anthropic_api_key_here"

# It's generally a good practice to use environment variables for API keys
# instead of hardcoding them. You could modify this file to use os.environ:

# import os
# GROQ_API_KEY = os.environ.get("GROQ_API_KEY")

# Remember to add your API key to your environment variables if you use this method.
